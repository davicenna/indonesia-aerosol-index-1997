# Indonesia's Aerosol Index in 1997

This repository contains MATLAB codes to generate a figure of the average of aerosol index levels in Indonesia during the 1997 forest fires using MATLAB's Mapping Toolbox. The aerosol index data comes from NASAâ€™s Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), which is accessible for free from NASA's Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure (Giovanni): https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/. 

High aerosol index is detected in parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan islands, corresponding to areas most affected by the fires.
